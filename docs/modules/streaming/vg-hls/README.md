# VgHLS @Directive

Component to stream with HLS an m3u8 playlist.

You can combine `VgDASH` and `VgHLS` together. If you pass a VOD file (that means, not HLS or DASH) it will fallback to the native video implementation.

`VgHLS` Directive is exported as `vgHls` in case you want to access to it from your template.

In this example `currentStream` can contain either an `mpd`, `m3u8` or `mp4` file.

```html
<vg-player>
    <video #media
           #vgHls="vgHls"
           [vgMedia]="media"
           [vgDash]="currentStream"
           [vgHls]="currentStream"
           id="singleVideo"
           controls
           crossorigin>
    </video>
</vg-player>
```

This module is dependant of `hls.js` library and you need to install via `npm install hls.js --save` and include it on your `.angular.json` config file:

```json
{
    ...
    "apps": [
        {

            ],
            ...
        }
    ],
    ...
}

```
